My name is Patrick Syme. I'm a student studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland. This is my second year studying at UMD, after studying Computer Science at Montgomery College for two years.<br>
While studying at UMD, I have programmed many projects, both for class and extracurricular, but three I would like to highlight are a C interpreter written in OCaml, a custom malloc project in C, and a voting system simulator.<br>
